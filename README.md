# Matcha



Matcha is(or will be) my attempt at implementing a VC generator using Scala, building upon the codebase of Dr. Wies.

# Resources
Inspired by Paulson and his [paper](https://arxiv.org/ftp/cs/papers/9301/9301110.pdf)

# TODO
* [ ] Change parsing of method to not using Com object
* [ ] Adding multiple arguments
* [ ] Adding return values
