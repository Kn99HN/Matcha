# Matcha



Matcha is(or will be) my attempt at implementing a VC generator using Scala, building upon the codebase of Dr. Wies.

# Resources
Inspired by Paulson and his [paper](https://arxiv.org/ftp/cs/papers/9301/9301110.pdf)

# TODO
* [ ] Change parsing of method to not using Com object
* [ ] Testing parsing of function call and replacement
* [ ] Apply stricter types for function calls when parsing
* [ ] Adding another layer of check for method calls out of scope later on
